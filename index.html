        <p>I was born with a single glowing ember rested within my soul. It lay in wait, ever-consuming, ever-growing, hidden nevertheless. Deep within the halls of my mind it festered, the door to its chamber wrought with ancient silver, its surface aged and weathered to the point of blackness. Carved upon it is a story told not in words, but in the language of art itself, holding a vision of sublimity and beauty such that it is understood at the moment of beholding. It is a story about me; rather, it is about what could be. All of my dreams fully realized across every dimension, hundreds of lifetimes abounding with ecstasy, sorrow, love, melancholy, and wonder. At the center of it all lies a hole fit for a key long shattered, its memory held only in fragments scattered about the earth and across time. Only after it has been assembled once more may the seal at last be shattered.</p>
        <p>Music is all I have in this life. It consumes my every moment, the core of my being yearning for it as long as I live. All I needed was to know where to look. As a child of the 2000s, social media had just started to sear its brand into my formative mind. I felt safer online, free of judgment, able to explore whatever I desired. It was unknown to me at the time, but I now feel as though I had never really existed inside of reality. The internet gave me everything I wanted, asking nothing in return, so why then must I continue to be tethered? This was a cruel trick of which I convinced myself. It kept me trapped, restrained from making a life for myself. Regardless, I still went deeper. Over the years, I indulged myself in many musical delights. The technology afforded to me had granted me the ability to access more than any era before me. It is in that sense I feel quite blessed to live in such an age, one where the art I can experience is truly endless. Every corner of the earth has been scoured, analyzed, and documented for all to see. If a hundred years ago, a symphony was a rare experience even for the ultra-wealthy, for me it is background music to my life. What a joy it is to be surrounded by such wonderful sounds at all hours of the day!</p>

      <section id="present" class="page" data-audio="present.mp3">
        <p>It was quite certain that I would begin composing. Surely the thousands of hours of music I could listen to was not enough for me. I needed to discover what I could say to the world, things I could never communicate in words. One particular interest of mine is to study score videos on YouTube! It is great practice understanding classical form and orchestration, skills I have tried my best to hone after years of practice.</p>
        <p>One day, I found a new score video, Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 5. It begins with a funeral march in C# Minor, a key which drips blood of deepest crimson. Its haunting melody unfolded before me, and in that moment I was transported. I stood inside the sanctum, facing a window which cast that same blood-red glow. It was ornate to the point of insanity; designs recursed into infinity, and in the glass's reflection saw myself bathed in shadow. I stood surrounded by the orchestra, leading them in a prayer of musical worship. And then, it was gone. In that moment, my destiny laid itself before me clear and outright. A piece of the sanctum key had fallen into my grasp. I must bring it to life. It is to that holy place I will lead you, joined together in song, to rejoice in beauty everlasting.</p>
        <p>I am now struck with a profound sense of helplessness. My goals are without a doubt lofty, especially for someone 150 years removed from the romantic era. However, I find solace in those whom share my interest in composing. Social media has allowed me to reach thousands with my voice that I never could have imagined, and it has connected me to other composers in my same position. I know now that I am not alone. For now, I spend my time sketching works, practicing my craft, and hoping someone cares what I have to say.</p>

      <section id="future" class="page" data-audio="future.mp3">
        <p>There are a lot of things I am unsure about in my life, but my desire to create is not one of them. A life lived alongside beautiful art and love for the world around me is all I need, and when I hopefully grow old, I hope it goes something like this:</p>
        <p>My life's work is complete: my grandest masterpiece, an apotheosis of hundreds of years of classical music for all to bear witness. At last, the ritual has begun. The hall retches and writhes in agony as the choir chants my requiem by candlelight. Finally, at the end of it all, evil itself seems to come undone, unable to bear the weight of our sacrifice. Heaven has manifested right here for but a moment. At that ultimate explosion of absolute ecstasy, I wish to be no more, for my work in this life has at last been finished. My symphony has come to a close, and after the lights of the hall go dark and the doors close for the last time, by body will be laid to rest on that very stage. My only hope is that those I have touched will go forth and spread love across the world, to finally see the beauty that lies inside within all of our hearts.</p>
        <p>That ancient sanctum door now stands open, the flame of my heart released from its cage. A new conductor must now see its halls filled with music, and I, free from toil and aching flesh, begin anew, this time on a work spun not from despair, but from hope. As I enter, I see the walls scorched from fear, pain, and doubt, but there is beauty in it. I climb the steps to the stage which now glows with a pale warm light, and see a crowd of musicians. They seem to have been expecting my arrival, and now wait their cue. I stand before them, and raise my baton.</p>
